Synthetic Dataset Generation using Nvidia Omniverse Replicator

In this work, I generate synthetic 2D scenes from 3D scenes using omniverse replicator embedded in the Nvidia Omniverse Code. The generated scenes contains objects with their respective 2D bounding box information. Although some conversion has to be made to make the bounding box information in npy YOLO compatible.

The python sripts alongside the samples of 3D assets used are provided.
